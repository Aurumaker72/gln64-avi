# gln64 avi

Fork of gln64 that cooperates with mupen during screen capture (which now probably makes no difference, maybe is a bit faster) and allows arbitrarily big windowed resolution, so you can upload dem freeruns at 4k (everybody uses direct64 anyway).

Trying to capture with this plugin on old mupen will most likely crash!!!
